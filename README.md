The two specific languages of focus are Amharic and Ukranian
- Amharic is the official language of Ethiopia and is a member of the Semitic language family.
- Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine and is a member of the Slavic language family.

The goal of the competition is to fine-tune the Gemma 2 model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two different low-resource languages.
Bringing AI to all corners of the world is an important goal of Google and this competition is a step in that direction.
